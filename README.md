# ADFEditor
An ADF package editor for a game called "Arsenal: Taste the Power". It allows for inspecting the contents of the package, extracting and reimporting individual files as well as adding files which were not originally in the package. This app can be used to make simple modifications to the game like changing the language files, editing graphics etc.

In order to build the solution you need to install additional WPF controls from Syncfusion and acquire a proper license. See [Syncfusion WPF Controls](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls) for proper instructions.

This program uses the Ookii.Dialogs.Wpf package released under the BSD 3-Clause License. See [this](https://github.com/ookii-dialogs/ookii-dialogs-wpf/blob/master/LICENSE) document for more information.
